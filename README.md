# ExpenseManager

Description

I developed an Expense Manager App, a user-friendly solution for efficient income and expense management. This project includes a tutorial on creating the app from scratch, covering the entire process and catering to programmers of all levels. Key features include precise tracking, customizable categories, and insightful visual reports. Technologies used encompass XML for frontend, Kotlin and MongoDB for backend, all structured within an MVVM architecture. This project demonstrates my proficiency in software engineering, database management, and user-centric design.
